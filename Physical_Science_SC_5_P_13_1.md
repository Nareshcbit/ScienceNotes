# Notes: Forces and Changes in Motion

## Overview
This standard focuses on identifying familiar forces that cause objects to move, including pushes, pulls, gravity (acting on falling objects), and magnetic force. It also involves recognizing scenarios where gravity is overcome and describing examples of magnetic attraction and repulsion, with a conceptual understanding of magnetic poles. The emphasis is on observable effects of forces, assessing no more than two forces at a time, and avoiding the context of separating mixtures/solutions.

## Part 1: Familiar Forces Causing Motion (SC.5.P.13.1)
- **Force Definition**: A push or pull that can cause an object to move, stop, or change direction.
- **Types of Forces**:
  - **Pushes and Pulls**:
    - **Push**: Applying force to move an object away (e.g., pushing a cart in a Florida store).
    - **Pull**: Applying force to move an object closer (e.g., pulling a wagon on a Florida beach).
    - **Effect**: Causes motion or changes in motion (e.g., speeding up, slowing down).
  - **Gravity**:
    - **Definition**: A force that pulls objects toward Earth’s center, causing them to fall or move downward.
    - **Effect**: Causes objects to fall (e.g., a ball dropped in a Florida park falls to the ground).
    - **Example**: An apple falling from a tree in a Florida orchard.
  - **Magnetic Force**:
    - **Definition**: A force exerted by magnets, attracting or repelling objects without contact.
    - **Effect**: Causes motion of magnetic materials or other magnets (e.g., a magnet pulling a paperclip in a Florida classroom).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Pushing a surfboard into waves (push).
  - Pulling a fishing net (pull).
  - A coconut falling from a palm tree (gravity).
  - A magnet attracting a steel nail (magnetic force).

## Part 2: Overcoming Gravity (SC.3.E.5.4)
- **Gravity’s Role**: Pulls objects downward unless another force opposes it.
- **Overcoming Gravity**:
  - **Pushing/Pulling Upward**: Forces like lifting or throwing counteract gravity temporarily (e.g., throwing a ball upward in a Florida park).
  - **Other Forces**: Buoyancy (e.g., a boat floating on water), thrust (e.g., a rocket launching), or support (e.g., a shelf holding a book).
  - **Scenarios**:
    - A kite rising in the wind (air pushing up).
    - A person jumping (muscle force pushing up).
    - A helium balloon floating (buoyancy overcoming gravity).
- **Florida Context**:
  - A seagull soaring upward (wing force vs. gravity).
  - A child lifting a beach ball (push vs. gravity).

## Part 3: Magnetic Attraction and Repulsion (SC.4.P.8.4)
- **Magnetic Force**:
  - Attracts magnetic materials (e.g., iron, steel, nickel) to magnets.
  - Attracts or repels other magnets based on poles.
- **Magnetic Poles**:
  - **Like Poles**: Repel (e.g., two north poles push apart).
  - **Unlike Poles**: Attract (e.g., north and south poles pull together).
- **Examples**:
  - **Attraction**: A magnet pulls a steel paperclip (no poles involved).
  - **Repulsion**: Two magnets with like poles push apart (e.g., north-north repulsion in a Florida science experiment).
- **Florida Context**:
  - A magnet attracting a steel bolt in a workshop.
  - Two magnets repelling when north poles face each other in a classroom.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Forces**: Pushes/pulls (direct contact), gravity (pulls downward), magnetic force (attracts/repels without contact).
- **Motion**: Forces cause objects to move, stop, or change direction.
- **Gravity**: Pulls objects to Earth; overcome by opposing forces (e.g., lifting, buoyancy).
- **Magnetic Force**: Attracts magnetic materials; like poles repel, unlike poles attract.
- **Limits**: Assess only pushes, pulls, gravity, magnetic force; two forces at a time; conceptual magnetic poles; no mixture/solution separation.
- **Florida Focus**: Use examples like beach activities, falling fruits, classroom magnets.
