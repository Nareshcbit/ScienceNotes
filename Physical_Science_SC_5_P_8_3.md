# Notes: Separating Mixtures and Dissolving Materials

## Overview
This standard focuses on demonstrating and explaining how mixtures of solids can be separated based on observable properties such as particle size, shape, color, and magnetic attraction. It also involves investigating which materials dissolve in water, which do not, and identifying conditions (temperature, stirring, surface area) that speed up or slow down the dissolving process. The emphasis is on practical, observable properties and conditions, avoiding technical terms like solution, solvent, solute, saturation, or catalyst, and not assessing the distinction between mixtures and solutions.

## Part 1: Mixtures of Solids and Separation Methods (SC.5.P.8.3)
- **Mixture Definition**: A combination of two or more solids that are physically mixed but not chemically bonded, retaining their individual properties (e.g., sand and pebbles, iron filings and salt).
- **Observable Properties for Separation**:
  - **Particle Size**: Larger particles can be separated from smaller ones (e.g., pebbles from sand using a sieve).
  - **Shape**: Differently shaped particles can be sorted (e.g., round beads from square blocks by hand or mesh).
  - **Color**: Differently colored materials can be separated visually (e.g., red and blue beads sorted by hand).
  - **Magnetic Attraction**: Magnetic materials (e.g., iron filings) can be separated from non-magnetic ones (e.g., sand) using a magnet.
- **Separation Methods**:
  - **Sieving/Screening**: Uses a mesh to separate by particle size (e.g., sifting sand from gravel).
  - **Hand Sorting**: Uses visual differences like color or shape (e.g., sorting colored marbles).
  - **Magnetic Separation**: Uses a magnet to attract magnetic materials (e.g., iron filings from sugar).
- **Examples in Florida Context**:
  - Separating seashells (large) from sand (small) on a beach using a sieve.
  - Sorting colorful plastic beads from a craft mix by color.
  - Using a magnet to separate iron nails from sawdust in a workshop.

## Part 2: Dissolving Materials in Water (SC.5.P.8.2)
- **Dissolving Definition**: When a solid material mixes completely with water, becoming invisible but still present (e.g., sugar in water).
- **Materials That Dissolve in Water** (common examples):
  - Sugar, salt, instant coffee, powdered drink mix, baking soda.
- **Materials That Do Not Dissolve in Water** (common examples):
  - Sand, pebbles, oil, chalk, plastic beads, metal filings.
- **Conditions Affecting Dissolving Speed**:
  - **Temperature**:
    - Higher temperature (hot water) speeds up dissolving by increasing particle movement (e.g., sugar dissolves faster in hot tea).
    - Lower temperature (cold water) slows dissolving (e.g., salt dissolves slower in iced water).
  - **Stirring**:
    - Stirring speeds up dissolving by mixing particles more quickly (e.g., stirring sugar in water).
    - No stirring slows dissolving, as particles settle (e.g., salt sitting at the bottom of a glass).
  - **Surface Area**:
    - Smaller particles (e.g., powdered sugar) dissolve faster due to more exposed surface area.
    - Larger particles (e.g., sugar cubes) dissolve slower due to less surface area.
- **Examples in Florida Context**:
  - Dissolving sugar in water to make lemonade at a picnic.
  - Sand not dissolving in ocean water at the beach.
  - Stirring instant coffee in hot water for faster dissolving.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Mixtures**: Solids mixed physically, separable by properties like particle size, shape, color, magnetic attraction.
- **Separation Methods**: Sieving (size), hand sorting (color/shape), magnets (magnetic attraction).
- **Dissolving**: Some solids (e.g., sugar, salt) dissolve in water; others (e.g., sand, oil) do not.
- **Conditions**: Hot water, stirring, and smaller particles speed up dissolving; cold water, no stirring, and larger particles slow it down.
- **Limits**: Focus on observable properties and conditions (temperature, stirring, surface area), not solution terminology, mixture vs. solution differences, or tool specifics.
- **Florida Focus**: Use relatable examples like sand, seashells, sugar, and water.

# Answers

1. **C**
   - **Explanation**: Magnetic attraction (C) allows iron filings (magnetic) to be separated from sand (non-magnetic) using a magnet. Particle size (A) and shape (D) require sieving or sorting, and color (B) is not distinct enough for these materials.

   - **Explanation**: Sugar (B) dissolves in water, mixing completely to make a drink. Sand (A), plastic beads (C), and chalk (D) do not dissolve, remaining visible or settling in water.

4. **B**
   - **Explanation**: Sorting by hand based on color (B) separates red and blue beads. Sieving (A) requires size differences, magnets (C) don’t attract beads, and dissolving (D) is irrelevant as beads don’t dissolve.

5. **C**
   - **Explanation**: Hot water (C) speeds up dissolving by increasing particle movement. Cold water (A) slows dissolving, no stirring (B) slows mixing, and large crystals (D) reduce surface area, slowing dissolving.

   - **Explanation**: Oil (C) does not dissolve in water, forming separate layers. Salt (A), instant coffee (B), and sugar (D) dissolve completely in water.

7. **B**
   - **Explanation**: Sorting by hand based on shape (B) separates differently shaped buttons. Magnets (A) don’t attract buttons, sieving (C) requires size differences, and buttons don’t dissolve (D).

8. **B**
   - **Explanation**: Stirring (B) makes sugar dissolve faster by mixing particles quickly. It doesn’t slow dissolving (A), prevent dissolving (C), or turn sugar into a solid (D).

9. **C**
   - **Explanation**: Particle size (C) allows a sieve to separate larger gravel from smaller sand. Color (A) and shape (D) require visual sorting, and neither is magnetic (B).

10. **C**
    - **Explanation**: Cold water (C) slows dissolving by reducing particle movement. Hot water (A) and stirring (B) speed it up, and powdered mix (D) increases surface area, speeding dissolving.

11. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Both iron nails and steel screws are magnetic (B), so a magnet attracts both, not separating them from each other but separating nails from non-magnetic wooden beads. Iron is magnetic (A), dissolving (C) is irrelevant, and size (D) isn’t the issue.

12. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Powdered sugar (B) has more surface area, dissolving faster than sugar cubes. Sugar cubes are slower (A, D), and surface area always affects dissolving speed (C).

13. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Adding water to dissolve salt, then filtering (B), separates salt from sand and iron filings, as salt dissolves while others don’t. Magnets (A) remove iron, sieving (C) separates sand, and color (D) is irrelevant.

16. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Hot water, stirring, and powdered sugar (B) maximize dissolving speed (high temperature, mixing, high surface area). Cold water (A, C) and sugar cubes (A, C, D) slow dissolving; no stirring (A, D) is slower.

17. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Iron filings are magnetic (B); plastic beads and sand are not, so a magnet separates iron from sand but not plastic from sand. Neither is magnetic (A), dissolving (C) is irrelevant, and size (D) isn’t the primary factor.

18. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Adding water to dissolve sugar, then filtering (B), separates sugar from non-dissolvable pebbles. Color sorting (A) is less efficient, pebbles aren’t magnetic (C), and shape sieving (D) is irrelevant.

20. **B**
    - **Explanation**: Sieving by size, then sorting by color (B), separates marbles efficiently. Magnets (A) don’t attract marbles, marbles don’t dissolve (C), and stirring (D) doesn’t separate by shape.
