# Notes: Earth in Space and Time - Galaxies and Stars

## Overview
This standard focuses on recognizing that a galaxy consists of gas, dust, many stars, and objects orbiting those stars, identifying the Milky Way as our home galaxy, and understanding star characteristics. It includes explaining that stars vary in size and brightness, appear as points of light due to distance (except the Sun), and that the Sun is a star emitting energy (visible light), appearing large and bright because it is the closest star to Earth. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding in Florida-relevant contexts, avoiding specific chemical compositions, numeric values, or the Sun’s effects on Earth.

## Part 1: Components of a Galaxy (SC.5.E.5.1)
- **Galaxy Definition**: A massive system of gas, dust, many stars, and objects (e.g., planets, asteroids) orbiting those stars.
- **Components**:
  - **Gas**: Clouds of hydrogen and helium, forming nebulae.
  - **Dust**: Tiny particles scattered among stars.
  - **Stars**: Massive, glowing balls of gas emitting light and heat.
  - **Orbiting Objects**: Planets, moons, asteroids, comets orbiting stars (not assessed in detail).
- **Milky Way**: Our home galaxy, containing the Sun and Earth.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observing the Milky Way in a clear Florida night sky.
  - Discussing stars and gas clouds visible through a telescope at a Florida observatory.

## Part 2: Star Differences (SC.3.E.5.1)
- **Star Variations**:
  - **Size**: Some stars are smaller (e.g., white dwarfs), others larger (e.g., supergiants).
  - **Brightness**: Some appear brighter (closer or larger stars), others dimmer (farther or smaller).
  - **Appearance**: All stars except the Sun appear as points of light due to their great distance from Earth.
- **Distance Effect**: Brightness depends on size and distance (closer stars appear brighter).
- **Example**: A large, distant star may appear dimmer than a smaller, closer star.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Comparing star brightness in a Florida planetarium.
  - Observing faint stars vs. bright ones at a beach stargazing event.

## Part 3: The Sun as a Star (SC.3.E.5.2, SC.3.E.5.3)
- **Sun’s Nature**:
  - A star that emits energy, including visible light.
  - Made of gases (e.g., hydrogen, helium, not assessed specifically).
- **Appearance**:
  - Appears large and bright because it is the closest star to Earth.
  - Other stars are so far they look like points of light, even through telescopes.
- **Energy**:
  - Emits light energy, allowing visibility (e.g., sunlight illuminating a Florida beach).
  - Assessment limited to visible light, not heat or other effects on Earth.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Sunlight brightening a Florida sunrise.
  - Comparing the Sun’s size/brightness to distant stars at a science center.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Galaxy**: Gas, dust, stars, orbiting objects; Milky Way is our galaxy.
- **Stars**: Vary in size (smaller/larger), brightness (closer/brighter), appear as points of light (except Sun).
- **Sun**: A star emitting visible light, appears large/bright due to proximity.
- **Limits**: Conceptual understanding, no chemical compositions, numeric distances, or Sun’s Earth effects.
- **Florida Focus**: Use night skies, beaches, observatories, planetariums for context.
