# Notes: Energy Causing Motion and Change

## Overview
This standard focuses on investigating and explaining that energy has the ability to cause motion (movement of objects) or create change (alterations in objects or environments). It includes recognizing examples of energy causing motion or change and describing how moving water and air act as energy sources to move things. The emphasis is on observable effects of energy, using light, heat, electrical, and mechanical energy, excluding sound and chemical energy, and avoiding weathering/erosion contexts.

## Part 1: Energy Causing Motion or Change (SC.5.P.10.2, SC.3.P.10.2, SC.4.P.10.2)
- **Energy Definition**: The ability to do work, causing motion (moving objects) or change (altering properties or states).
- **Forms of Energy Assessed**:
  - **Light Energy**: Causes changes like heating or fading materials.
    - Example: Sunlight fading a shirt in Florida.
  - **Heat (Thermal) Energy**: Causes motion (e.g., air rising) or changes (e.g., melting, expanding materials).
    - Example: Heat melting ice in a Florida drink.
  - **Electrical Energy**: Causes motion (e.g., powering motors) or changes (e.g., lighting bulbs).
    - Example: Electricity moving a fan in a Florida home.
  - **Mechanical Energy**: Energy of moving objects, causing motion or physical changes.
    - Example: A ball rolling down a Florida hill pushes another object.
- **Motion**:
  - Movement of objects, described with comparative terms (e.g., faster, slower, greater than).
  - Example: Electrical energy moves a toy car faster than a hand push.
- **Change**:
  - Alterations in state, appearance, or position (e.g., melting, breaking, heating).
  - Example: Heat energy changes solid butter to liquid in a Florida kitchen.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Sunlight heating sand, causing it to feel hot (change).
  - Electrical energy moving a boat’s motor (motion).

## Part 2: Moving Water and Air as Energy Sources (SC.4.P.10.4)
- **Moving Water**:
  - **Energy Source**: Water’s motion carries mechanical energy to move objects.
  - **Examples**:
    - Waves pushing a surfboard on a Florida beach.
    - River currents turning a waterwheel in a historical mill.
  - **Mechanism**: Flowing water transfers energy to objects, causing motion (e.g., spinning turbines, moving boats).
- **Moving Air (Wind)**:
  - **Energy Source**: Wind’s motion carries mechanical energy to move objects.
  - **Examples**:
    - Wind pushing a sailboat in Florida’s Gulf.
    - Wind spinning a windmill in a coastal area.
  - **Mechanism**: Moving air exerts force, causing motion (e.g., turning blades, moving kites).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Hurricanes’ strong winds moving debris.
  - Ocean waves moving floating toys.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Energy’s Role**: Causes motion (movement) or change (alteration) in objects/environments.
- **Forms Assessed**: Light (fading, heating), heat (melting, expanding), electrical (powering motion), mechanical (moving objects).
- **Exclusions**: Sound and chemical energy are not assessed.
- **Water and Air**: Moving water (waves, rivers) and air (wind) are mechanical energy sources causing motion.
- **Limits**: Avoid weathering/erosion, sound/chemical energy, or complex energy transformations.
- **Florida Focus**: Use examples like sunlight, ocean waves, wind, and electrical devices in local settings.
- **Comparative Terms**: Use greater than, less than, faster, slower for motion.
