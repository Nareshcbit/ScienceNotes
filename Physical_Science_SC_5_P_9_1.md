# Notes: Temperature and Changes in Matter

## Overview
This standard focuses on investigating and describing how temperature affects physical and chemical changes in matter. It includes understanding the physical changes water undergoes when heated or cooled (melting, freezing, boiling, evaporation, condensation) and identifying familiar changes in materials (decaying, burning, rusting, cooking) that produce new materials with different characteristics. The emphasis is on observable changes and their relation to temperature, not particle motion or complex chemical processes.

## Part 1: Physical and Chemical Changes Affected by Temperature (SC.5.P.9.1)
- **Physical Changes**:
  - **Definition**: Changes in a material’s state or appearance without forming a new substance (e.g., shape, size, or state changes like solid to liquid).
  - **Temperature Influence**:
    - **Heating**: Increases energy, causing solids to melt (e.g., ice to water) or liquids to evaporate/boil (e.g., water to steam).
    - **Cooling**: Decreases energy, causing gases to condense (e.g., steam to water) or liquids to freeze (e.g., water to ice).
  - **Examples**:
    - Melting butter in a hot pan (solid to liquid).
    - Evaporating water in a Florida puddle under the sun (liquid to gas).
    - Freezing juice into popsicles in a freezer (liquid to solid).
- **Chemical Changes**:
  - **Definition**: Changes that produce new substances with different properties (e.g., burning wood produces ash).
  - **Temperature Influence**:
    - **Heating**: Speeds up reactions (e.g., cooking food faster at higher temperatures, burning wood with heat).
    - **Cooling**: Slows reactions (e.g., slowing rust formation in cold conditions).
  - **Examples**:
    - Cooking an egg (heat changes proteins, creating a new texture).
    - Burning paper (heat produces ash and smoke).
    - Rusting iron (faster in warm, humid Florida conditions).

## Part 2: Physical Changes of Water (SC.3.P.9.1)
- **State Changes of Water**:
  - **Melting**: Solid to liquid (e.g., ice melts to water when heated above 0°C).
  - **Freezing**: Liquid to solid (e.g., water freezes to ice when cooled below 0°C).
  - **Boiling**: Liquid to gas (e.g., water boils to steam at 100°C under standard pressure).
  - **Evaporation**: Liquid to gas at the surface, often below boiling point (e.g., puddle water evaporates in warm Florida weather).
  - **Condensation**: Gas to liquid (e.g., water vapor condenses on a cold glass in humid Florida air).
- **Temperature’s Role**:
  - Heating causes melting, evaporation, or boiling.
  - Cooling causes freezing or condensation.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Evaporation of ocean water on hot beaches.
  - Condensation on cold drinks during humid summers.
  - Freezing water in rare cold snaps for ice.

## Part 3: Familiar Changes in Materials (SC.4.P.9.1)
- **Changes Producing New Materials**:
  - **Decaying**: Organic matter breaks down, forming new substances (e.g., fallen leaves in a Florida forest decay into compost).
  - **Burning**: Combines materials with oxygen, producing new substances (e.g., burning wood creates ash and smoke).
  - **Rusting**: Iron reacts with oxygen and water, forming rust (e.g., rust on a bike left in Florida’s humid climate).
  - **Cooking**: Heat alters food, creating new textures/flavors (e.g., baking dough into bread).
- **Temperature’s Role**:
  - Decay and rusting are faster in warm, humid conditions.
  - Burning requires high temperatures to start.
  - Cooking is faster and more effective at higher temperatures.
- **New Characteristics**:
  - Decayed leaves: Dark, crumbly compost vs. green leaves.
  - Burned wood: Black ash vs. brown wood.
  - Rusted iron: Reddish, flaky rust vs. shiny metal.
  - Cooked egg: Firm, opaque vs. runny, transparent.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Physical Changes**: Temperature-driven state changes (e.g., melting, freezing) without new substances.
- **Chemical Changes**: Temperature affects reaction speed, producing new substances (e.g., burning, rusting).
- **Water Changes**: Melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), boiling/evaporation (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid).
- **Material Changes**: Decay, burning, rusting, cooking create new materials with different properties.
- **Temperature**: Heating speeds up changes (melting, cooking); cooling slows or reverses them (freezing, slowing rust).
- **Limits**: Focus on observable changes, not particle motion or complex chemistry.
- **Florida Focus**: Use examples like evaporating puddles, rusting in humidity, cooking local foods.
