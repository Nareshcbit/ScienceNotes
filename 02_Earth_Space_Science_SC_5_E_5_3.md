# Notes: Solar System Objects and Planet Characteristics

## Overview
This standard focuses on distinguishing among Solar System objects (Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets) based on their characteristics and relative positions, identifying Earth’s position in the Solar System, recognizing common characteristics of all planets, and comparing/contrasting inner and outer planets. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding in Florida-relevant contexts, limited to specific planet characteristics (surface composition, atmosphere, size, position, moons, rings, temperature, year length), avoiding Sun characteristics, quantitative data, object interactions, or gravity.

## Part 1: Solar System Objects (SC.5.E.5.3)
- **Solar System Definition**: A collection of objects orbiting the Sun, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
- **Objects and Characteristics**:
  - **Sun**: Central star emitting light and heat (characteristics not assessed).
  - **Planets**: Large bodies orbiting the Sun, no light emission, with common characteristics (see Part 2).
    - Example: Earth, Jupiter.
  - **Moons**: Natural satellites orbiting planets, varying in size and composition.
    - Example: Earth’s Moon, Jupiter’s Ganymede.
  - **Asteroids**: Small, rocky bodies orbiting the Sun, mostly found between Mars and Jupiter (asteroid belt, not deeply assessed).
    - Example: Ceres.
  - **Comets**: Icy bodies with dust and gas, developing tails when near the Sun, orbiting in elongated paths.
    - Example: Halley’s Comet.
- **Earth’s Position**: Third planet from the Sun, after Mercury and Venus, before Mars.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observing planets like Jupiter through a telescope at a Florida observatory.
  - Discussing comets visible in a Florida night sky.

## Part 2: Common Planet Characteristics (SC.5.E.5.2)
- **Common Characteristics**:
  - Orbit the Sun.
  - Spherical or nearly spherical shape.
  - Have mass and gravity to maintain orbits.
  - Do not emit their own light (reflect Sun’s light).
- **Examples**:
  - All planets (Mercury to Neptune) orbit the Sun and are spherical.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Teaching planet orbits in a Florida planetarium.
  - Observing Mars’ reflection in a clear Florida sky.

## Part 3: Inner vs. Outer Planets (SC.5.E.5.2)
- **Inner Planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars):
  - **Surface Composition**: Mostly solid (rocky, terrestrial).
  - **Atmosphere**: Thin or present (e.g., Earth’s thick atmosphere, Mars’ thin).
  - **Relative Size**: Smaller than outer planets.
  - **Position**: Closer to the Sun (first four planets).
  - **Moons**: Few or none (Earth: 1, Mars: 2, Mercury/Venus: 0).
  - **Rings**: None.
  - **Temperature**: Warmer due to proximity to Sun.
  - **Length of Year**: Shorter (e.g., Earth: 365 days, Mercury: 88 days).
- **Outer Planets** (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune):
  - **Surface Composition**: Mostly gas (gas giants, no solid surface).
  - **Atmosphere**: Thick, composed of gases like hydrogen and helium.
  - **Relative Size**: Larger than inner planets.
  - **Position**: Farther from the Sun (beyond asteroid belt).
  - **Moons**: Many (e.g., Jupiter: 79+, Saturn: 83+).
  - **Rings**: Present (e.g., Saturn’s prominent rings, others less visible).
  - **Temperature**: Colder due to distance from Sun.
  - **Length of Year**: Longer (e.g., Jupiter: 11.86 Earth years, Neptune: 164.8 years).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Comparing Earth (inner, rocky) to Jupiter (outer, gaseous) in a science center.
  - Observing Saturn’s rings through a telescope at a Florida stargazing event.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Solar System Objects**:
  - Sun: Central star (not assessed).
  - Planets: Orbit Sun, spherical, no light emission.
  - Moons: Orbit planets.
  - Asteroids: Rocky, orbit Sun.
  - Comets: Icy, develop tails near Sun.
- **Earth’s Position**: Third planet from Sun.
- **Planet Characteristics**: Orbit Sun, spherical, reflect light.
- **Inner vs. Outer Planets**:
  - Inner: Rocky, smaller, closer, warmer, few/no moons, no rings, shorter years.
  - Outer: Gaseous, larger, farther, colder, many moons, rings, longer years.
- **Limits**: Conceptual, no Sun characteristics, quantitative data, interactions, gravity, or detailed asteroid belt.
- **Florida Focus**: Use observatories, planetariums, night skies for context.
