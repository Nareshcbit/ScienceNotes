# Notes: Properties of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

## Overview
This standard focuses on comparing and contrasting the basic physical properties of solids, liquids, and gases, such as mass, volume, color, texture, temperature, shape, hardness, odor, taste, and attraction to magnets. It also involves measuring and comparing these properties and classifying materials as solid, liquid, or gas. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding, not particle behavior, the water cycle, density, weight vs. mass, unit conversions, or detailed tool knowledge.

## Part 1: States of Matter and Their Properties (SC.5.P.8.1)
- **Solids**:
  - **Definition**: Have a definite shape and volume; particles are tightly packed.
  - **Properties**:
    - **Mass**: Measurable (e.g., a rock has more mass than a feather).
    - **Volume**: Fixed (e.g., a block of wood occupies a specific space).
    - **Shape**: Definite (e.g., a pencil keeps its shape).
    - **Color**: Varies (e.g., red apple, gray stone).
    - **Texture**: Varies (e.g., smooth glass, rough sandpaper).
    - **Temperature**: Varies (e.g., cold ice, warm metal).
    - **Hardness**: Varies (e.g., hard diamond, soft clay).
    - **Odor**: May have (e.g., smelly cheese).
    - **Taste**: May have (e.g., sweet candy).
    - **Attraction to Magnets**: Some solids (e.g., iron) are magnetic; others (e.g., wood) are not.
- **Liquids**:
  - **Definition**: Have a definite volume but take the shape of their container; particles are less tightly packed than solids.
  - **Properties**:
    - **Mass**: Measurable (e.g., a liter of water has mass).
    - **Volume**: Fixed (e.g., 500 mL of juice).
    - **Shape**: Indefinite, conforms to container (e.g., water in a cup).
    - **Color**: Varies (e.g., blue food coloring, clear water).
    - **Texture**: Often smooth or viscous (e.g., slippery oil, thick syrup).
    - **Temperature**: Varies (e.g., cold milk, hot soup).
    - **Hardness**: Not applicable (liquids are not rigid).
    - **Odor**: May have (e.g., vinegar’s sharp smell).
    - **Taste**: May have (e.g., salty broth).
    - **Attraction to Magnets**: Liquids (e.g., water, oil) are typically not magnetic.
- **Gases**:
  - **Definition**: Have no definite shape or volume; particles are far apart and spread to fill their container.
  - **Properties**:
    - **Mass**: Measurable but often low (e.g., helium in a balloon).
    - **Volume**: Indefinite, fills container (e.g., air in a room).
    - **Shape**: Indefinite, fills container (e.g., oxygen in a tank).
    - **Color**: Often colorless (e.g., air, oxygen), some visible (e.g., chlorine gas is greenish).
    - **Texture**: Not applicable (gases are not tangible).
    - **Temperature**: Varies (e.g., cold compressed air, hot steam).
    - **Hardness**: Not applicable (gases are not rigid).
    - **Odor**: May have (e.g., natural gas’s distinct smell).
    - **Taste**: Rarely applicable (gases are not typically tasted).
    - **Attraction to Magnets**: Gases are not magnetic.

## Part 2: Measuring and Comparing Properties (SC.3.P.8.1, SC.3.P.8.2, SC.4.P.8.1)
- **Temperature**: Measured with a thermometer (°F or °C).
  - Example: Ice (solid) at 0°C is colder than water (liquid) at 20°C.
- **Mass**: Measured with a balance or scale.
  - Example: A metal block (solid) has more mass than an equal volume of water (liquid).
- **Volume**: Measured with tools like graduated cylinders for liquids or rulers for solids.
  - Example: 100 mL of juice (liquid) vs. a 100 cm³ wooden cube (solid).
- **Shape, Color, Texture, Hardness, Odor, Taste, Attraction to Magnets**:
  - Compared observationally or with simple tests.
  - Example: A steel nail (solid, hard, magnetic) vs. oil (liquid, smooth, non-magnetic).

## Part 3: Classifying Materials (SC.5.P.8.1, SC.3.P.8.3)
- **Solid**: Fixed shape and volume (e.g., rock, pencil, ice).
- **Liquid**: Fixed volume, takes container’s shape (e.g., water, milk, oil).
- **Gas**: No fixed shape or volume (e.g., air, helium, carbon dioxide).
- **Examples in Florida Context**:
  - Solid: Sand on beaches, coral rocks.
  - Liquid: Ocean water, orange juice.
  - Gas: Air in the atmosphere, helium in balloons at festivals.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Properties Compared**: Mass, volume, shape, color, texture, temperature, hardness, odor, taste, attraction to magnets.
- **Solids**: Definite shape/volume, can be hard/soft, magnetic/non-magnetic.
- **Liquids**: Definite volume, indefinite shape, non-magnetic, varying viscosity.
- **Gases**: Indefinite shape/volume, often colorless, non-magnetic.
- **Classification**: Identify materials as solid, liquid, or gas based on properties.
- **Limits**: Focus on properties, not particle behavior, water cycle, density, weight vs. mass, unit conversions, or specific tool details.
- **Florida Focus**: Use relatable examples like sand, ocean water, and air.
