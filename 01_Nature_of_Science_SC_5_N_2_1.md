# Notes: Characteristics of Scientific Knowledge

## Overview
This standard emphasizes that science is grounded in testable observations (evidence) and that explanations must be supported by evidence, not personal opinions or interpretations. It highlights that scientific investigations do not always follow a rigid “scientific method” but rely on observations and evidence. Students must distinguish between observations (factual data) and opinions/interpretations (subjective beliefs or assumptions). The focus is on conceptual understanding in Florida-relevant contexts, avoiding the steps or order of the scientific method.

## Part 1: Science and Empirical Observations (SC.5.N.2.1, SC.3.N.1.7, SC.4.N.1.7)
- **Science Definition**: A process of understanding the natural world through testable observations and evidence.
- **Observations (Evidence)**:
  - Factual data collected through senses or measurements (e.g., “The water temperature is 25°C on a Florida beach”).
  - Must be testable (can be repeated or verified by others).
  - Example: Measuring the height of mangroves in a Florida swamp.
- **Explanations**:
  - Must be linked to evidence, not assumptions (e.g., “Mangroves grow taller in sunny areas because data shows taller plants in sunlight”).
  - Example: Explaining dolphin behavior based on observed jump frequencies.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observing tide levels to explain coastal flooding.
  - Measuring rainfall to explain wet seasons.

## Part 2: Flexibility of Scientific Investigations (SC.4.N.1.3, SC.5.N.1.5)
- **Scientific Method**:
  - Not a rigid sequence (e.g., question, hypothesis, experiment, conclusion); science varies in approach.
  - Always involves observations and evidence, but methods differ (e.g., field observations vs. lab experiments).
- **Examples**:
  - Observing manatee migration patterns in a Florida river (field study, no rigid steps).
  - Testing plant growth with different soils in a lab (structured experiment, still evidence-based).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Studying coral bleaching through observations over time, not a fixed method.
  - Experimenting with water salinity on seagrass, using evidence but flexible steps.

## Part 3: Observations vs. Opinions/Interpretations (SC.5.N.1.6)
- **Observations**:
  - Objective facts (e.g., “The sand is 30°C”).
  - Verifiable by others (e.g., measurable with a thermometer).
- **Opinions/Interpretations**:
  - Subjective beliefs or assumptions (e.g., “The sand feels too hot to walk on”).
  - Not testable/verifiable (e.g., “The beach is the best in Florida”).
- **Distinguishing**:
  - Observations are data-driven; opinions are personal (e.g., “Clouds are gray” vs. “Clouds look scary”).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observation: “Dolphins jumped 5 times in 10 minutes.”
  - Opinion: “Dolphins are having fun.”
  - Interpretation: “Dolphins jump because they’re hungry” (needs evidence to verify).

## Key Points to Remember
- **Science**: Based on testable observations (evidence), not assumptions.
- **Explanations**: Must be supported by data, not opinions.
- **Investigations**: Flexible, not rigid scientific method, but always evidence-based.
- **Observations vs. Opinions**: Observations are factual/testable; opinions are subjective/not testable.
- **Limits**: Avoid scientific method steps/order, use “observations” and “evidence” terms.
- **Florida Focus**: Use beaches, mangroves, dolphins, weather for context.
