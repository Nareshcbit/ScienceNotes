# Notes: The Practice of Science

## Overview
This standard focuses on the scientific process, including defining problems, using reference materials to support understanding, planning and conducting investigations (e.g., observations, experiments with variables and control groups), collecting and organizing data, interpreting data in charts/tables/graphics, analyzing information, making predictions, and defending conclusions. It also involves distinguishing between experiments (with controlled variables/control groups) and other investigations, identifying observations, predictions, and inferences, and understanding the role of a control group. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding of the scientific method in Florida-relevant contexts, without requiring hypothesis evaluation, procedure design, or mathematical computations.

## Part 1: Scientific Investigations (SC.5.N.1.1, SC.3.N.1.1, SC.4.N.1.1)
- **Defining a Problem**:
  - Identifying a question about the natural world (e.g., “Why do some plants grow faster in Florida?”).
  - Example: Investigating why seashells vary in size on a Florida beach.
- **Using Reference Materials**:
  - Books, websites, or guides to support understanding (e.g., a field guide to identify Florida birds).
  - Focus: Using credible sources, not specific knowledge of materials.
- **Types of Investigations**:
  - **Observations**: Noticing and recording phenomena (e.g., observing tide patterns in a Florida bay).
  - **Experiments**: Testing variables with a control group (e.g., testing plant growth with different soils).
  - **Free Exploration**: Informal investigation (e.g., exploring which objects float in a Florida pool).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observing manatee behavior in a river.
  - Experimenting with sand types for building castles on a beach.

## Part 2: Experiments vs. Other Investigations (SC.5.N.1.2)
- **Experiment**:
  - Involves controlled variables (one factor changed, others constant) and often a control group.
  - Example: Testing how sunlight affects plant growth (sunlight vs. shade, control group in shade).
- **Other Investigations**:
  - Lack controlled variables/control groups (e.g., observing weather patterns without manipulating factors).
  - Example: Recording daily temperatures in a Florida backyard (observation, not experiment).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Experiment: Testing how water types affect coral growth.
  - Observation: Noting cloud types during a Florida storm.

## Part 3: Control Group (SC.5.N.1.4)
- **Control Group**:
  - A group in an experiment not exposed to the tested variable, used for comparison.
  - **Importance**: Shows the effect of the variable by comparing to a baseline (e.g., plants without fertilizer vs. fertilized plants).
  - Example: Testing sugar’s effect on yeast growth; control group has no sugar.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Control group of plants in regular soil vs. fertilized soil in a garden experiment.

## Part 4: Observations, Predictions, Inferences (SC.4.N.1.6)
- **Observation**: Noticing facts using senses (e.g., “The sand is hot on a Florida beach”).
- **Prediction**: Guessing future outcomes based on patterns (e.g., “It will rain this afternoon based on clouds”).
- **Inference**: Explaining observations with reasoning (e.g., “The tide is high because of the moon’s position”).
- **Record Keeping**:
  - Accurate records distinguish observations from inferences (e.g., “The water is 25°C” vs. “The water is warm because it’s sunny”).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Observing dolphin jumps, predicting more jumps at dusk, inferring hunger drives jumps.

## Part 5: Data Collection, Interpretation, and Analysis (SC.5.N.1.1)
- **Collecting/Organizing Data**:
  - Using tables, charts, or graphs to record data (e.g., a table of daily tide heights in a Florida bay).
- **Interpreting Data**:
  - Analyzing patterns in charts/tables/graphics (e.g., noticing plants grow taller with more water).
- **Making Predictions**:
  - Using data to forecast outcomes (e.g., predicting faster plant growth with fertilizer based on prior data).
- **Defending Conclusions**:
  - Explaining results with evidence (e.g., “Fertilized plants grew taller due to nutrient data”).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Charting mangrove growth, predicting faster growth in sunny areas, concluding sunlight aids growth.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Investigations**: Observations (noticing), experiments (variables/control group), free exploration.
- **Experiments**: Have controlled variables/control groups; others (e.g., observations) do not.
- **Control Group**: Baseline for comparison in experiments.
- **Observations vs. Inferences**: Observations are facts; inferences are explanations; predictions are guesses.
- **Data**: Collect in tables/charts, interpret patterns, predict outcomes, defend conclusions.
- **Limits**: Conceptual, no hypothesis evaluation, procedure design, calculations, or variable differentiation.
- **Florida Focus**: Use beaches, mangroves, manatees, weather for context.
