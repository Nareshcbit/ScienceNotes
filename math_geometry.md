# Geometry: Notes and Multiple-Choice Questions

## Notes on Geometry (Aligned with Florida Math Standards, Grades 5–8)

### 5th Grade (MAFS.5.G.1, MAFS.5.G.2)
1. **Coordinate Plane**:
   - The coordinate plane has two axes: the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).
   - Points are plotted using ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the horizontal distance and $y$ is the vertical distance from the origin $(0, 0)$.
   - Example: Plot $(3, 4)$ by moving 3 units right and 4 units up.

2. **Classifying Shapes**:
   - Classify two-dimensional shapes (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals) by properties like sides and angles.
   - Examples: A rectangle has four right angles; a rhombus has four equal sides.
   - Hierarchy: A square is a special rectangle and rhombus.

### 6th Grade (MAFS.6.G.1)
3. **Area and Perimeter**:
   - **Area**: Measures the space inside a shape.
     - Rectangle: $A = l \times w$ (length $\times$ width).
     - Triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$ (base $\times$ height).
   - **Perimeter**: Sum of all side lengths.
     - Rectangle: $P = 2l + 2w$.
   - Decompose complex shapes into rectangles and triangles to find area.

4. **Surface Area and Volume**:
   - **Surface Area**: Sum of areas of all faces of a 3D shape (e.g., rectangular prism).
     - Rectangular prism: $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$.
   - **Volume**: Space inside a 3D shape.
     - Rectangular prism: $V = l \times w \times h$.

### 7th Grade (MAFS.7.G.1, MAFS.7.G.2)
5. **Scale Drawings**:
   - Scale drawings represent real objects with proportional dimensions.
   - Scale factor: Ratio of drawing length to actual length.
   - Example: A 1:100 scale means 1 cm in the drawing equals 100 cm in reality.

6. **Properties of Shapes**:
   - Draw and construct triangles using conditions (e.g., side lengths, angle measures).
   - Conditions for a unique triangle: Three sides (SSS), two sides and included angle (SAS), etc.
   - Circles: Circumference $C = 2 \pi r$ or $C = \pi d$; Area $A = \pi r^2$.

7. **Area, Volume, and Surface Area**:
   - Solve problems involving area and circumference of circles.
   - Find volume and surface area of prisms, pyramids, and composite figures.

### 8th Grade (MAFS.8.G.1, MAFS.8.G.2, MAFS.8.G.3)
8. **Transformations**:
   - Types: Translations (slides), rotations (turns), reflections (flips), dilations (resizing).
   - Congruence: Shapes are congruent if they have the same size and shape (after translations, rotations, reflections).
   - Similarity: Shapes are similar if they have the same shape but different sizes (after dilations).

9. **Angles and Triangles**:
   - Angle relationships: Vertical angles are equal; angles on a straight line sum to $180^\circ$.
   - Exterior angle theorem: An exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   - Sum of interior angles in a triangle: $180^\circ$.

10. **Pythagorean Theorem (MAFS.8.G.2)**:
    - Applies to right triangles: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.
    - Use to find missing side lengths or verify right triangles.

## Answers and Explanations

1. **Answer**: B) 5 units right, 2 units up
   - **Explanation**: In the coordinate plane, an ordered pair $(x, y)$ indicates moving $x$ units horizontally (right if positive) and $y$ units vertically (up if positive) from $(0, 0)$. For $(5, 2)$, move 5 units right and 2 units up.

2. **Answer**: A) 24 cm²
   - **Explanation**: The area of a rectangle is $A = l \times w$. For length 8 cm and width 3 cm: $A = 8 \times 3 = 24$ cm².

3. **Answer**: B) 24 m³
   - **Explanation**: The volume of a rectangular prism is $V = l \times w \times h$. For length 4 m, width 3 m, height 2 m: $V = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$ m³.

4. **Answer**: B) 10 m
   - **Explanation**: The scale 1 cm : 2 m means 1 cm in the drawing represents 2 m in reality. For a drawing length of 5 cm: $5 \times 2 = 10$ m.

5. **Answer**: A) 18.84 cm
   - **Explanation**: The circumference of a circle is $C = 2 \pi r$. For radius 3 cm and $\pi \approx 3.14$: $C = 2 \times 3.14 \times 3 = 18.84$ cm.

6. **Answer**: A) $50^\circ$
   - **Explanation**: The sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. For angles $40^\circ$ and $70^\circ$, the third angle is: $180 - 40 - 70 = 50^\circ$.

7. **Answer**: B) Reflection
   - **Explanation**: Reflections, translations, and rotations preserve size and shape (congruence). Dilations change size (similarity), and stretching/shearing distort shapes.

8. **Answer**: A) 10 cm
   - **Explanation**: Use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. For legs 6 cm and 8 cm: $6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$, so $c = \sqrt{100} = 10$ cm.

9. **Answer**: C) Rectangle
   - **Explanation**: A quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides equal is a rectangle. A rhombus has equal sides but not necessarily right angles; a trapezoid has only one pair of parallel sides.

10. **Answer**: A) 94 cm²
    - **Explanation**: The surface area of a rectangular prism is $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$. For dimensions 5 cm, 4 cm, 3 cm: $SA = 2(5 \times 4 + 5 \times 3 + 4 \times 3) = 2(20 + 15 + 12) = 2 \times 47 = 94$ cm².
