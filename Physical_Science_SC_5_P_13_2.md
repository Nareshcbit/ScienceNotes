# Notes: Forces, Mass, and Motion

## Overview
This standard focuses on investigating and describing how the greater the force applied to an object, the greater the change in its motion, and how an object’s mass affects the impact of a given force. It also covers how objects in motion change position and may change direction, how speed is determined by distance traveled over time, and how opposing forces, including friction, create balanced or unbalanced forces affecting movement. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding, using pushes, pulls, and friction, with forces in newtons (N), without mathematical calculations or net force.

## Part 1: Force and Motion (SC.5.P.13.2)
- **Force Definition**: A push or pull that causes an object to move, stop, or change direction, measured in newtons (N).
- **Relationship with Motion**:
  - **Greater Force**: Increases the change in motion (e.g., faster movement, greater direction change).
    - Example: Pushing a cart with 10 N moves it slowly; 20 N moves it faster in a Florida store.
  - **Change in Motion**: Includes starting, stopping, speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Pushing a surfboard harder into waves increases its speed.
  - Pulling a wagon with more force accelerates it on a beach.

## Part 2: Motion, Position, and Direction (SC.4.P.12.1)
- **Motion**: Movement of an object, always changing its position (location).
  - Example: A rolling ball in a Florida park moves from one spot to another.
- **Direction**: Motion may change direction (e.g., a ball kicked left then right).
  - Example: A kite in a Florida wind shifts direction with gusts.
- **Florida Context**:
  - A boat moving across a lake changes position.
  - A bike turning on a Florida trail changes direction.

## Part 3: Speed (SC.4.P.12.2)
- **Speed Definition**: How fast an object moves, determined by distance traveled in a unit of time (e.g., meters per second, conceptually).
  - Example: A car traveling 100 meters in 10 seconds is faster than one traveling 50 meters in 10 seconds.
- **Different Speeds**: Objects move at varying speeds based on force and mass.
  - Example: A bicycle moves slower than a car in a Florida race.
- **Florida Context**:
  - A dolphin swims faster than a manatee in the ocean.
  - A child runs slower than a dog in a park.

## Part 4: Mass and Force (SC.5.P.13.3)
- **Mass Definition**: Amount of matter in an object, affecting how it responds to force.
- **Relationship with Force**:
  - **More Mass**: Less effect from a given force (e.g., harder to move a heavy object).
    - Example: A 10 N push moves a light box farther than a heavy box in a Florida classroom.
  - **Less Mass**: Greater effect from a given force (e.g., easier to move a light object).
- **Florida Context**:
  - Pushing a small beach ball is easier than pushing a heavy cooler.
  - A light kite moves more with wind than a heavy one.

## Part 5: Opposing Forces and Balanced/Unbalanced Forces (SC.5.P.13.4)
- **Opposing Forces**: Forces acting in opposite directions (e.g., push vs. pull, friction vs. push).
- **Friction**:
  - **Definition**: A force resisting motion between surfaces (e.g., rough surfaces create more friction).
  - **Effect**: Slows or stops motion (e.g., a ball stops rolling on grass due to friction).
  - **Example**: Pushing a box on a sandy Florida beach is harder due to friction.
- **Balanced Forces**: Equal opposing forces, no motion (e.g., pushing a wall with 10 N, wall pushes back with 10 N).
  - Example: A book on a table doesn’t move due to balanced forces (gravity vs. table’s support).
- **Unbalanced Forces**: Unequal forces, causing motion (e.g., a 20 N push overcomes 10 N friction).
  - Example: Pulling a sled with 15 N overcomes 5 N friction, causing motion.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Friction slows a skateboard on a rough sidewalk.
  - Balanced forces keep a anchored boat still in a harbor.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Force and Motion**: Greater force = greater change in motion (speed, direction).
- **Motion**: Changes position, may change direction.
- **Speed**: Distance over time; objects have different speeds.
- **Mass**: More mass = less motion for a given force.
- **Opposing Forces**: Friction resists motion; balanced forces prevent motion, unbalanced cause it.
- **Forces Assessed**: Pushes, pulls, friction (not gravity or magnetic force here).
- **Limits**: Conceptual understanding, no calculations, two forces max, no net force, friction as resistance.
- **Florida Focus**: Use examples like beach activities, classroom objects, local vehicles.
