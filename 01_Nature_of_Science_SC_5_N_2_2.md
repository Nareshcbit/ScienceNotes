# Notes: Replicability and Evidence in Scientific Investigations

## Overview
This standard emphasizes that scientific investigations produce evidence (data, observations, results, conclusions) that should be replicable by others to ensure reliability. It involves comparing observations across groups using the same or multiple tools, explaining differences due to tools or procedures, recognizing the need for repeated trials, and understanding that scientists question, discuss, and check each other’s evidence and explanations. The focus is on conceptual understanding in Florida-relevant contexts, avoiding explicit assessment of terms like “accurate” or “valid.”

## Part 1: Replicability of Evidence (SC.5.N.2.2)
- **Replicability**:
  - Evidence from scientific investigations (data, observations, results, conclusions) should be repeatable by others under similar conditions.
  - Ensures findings are reliable and not due to chance or error.
  - Example: Measuring tide heights on a Florida beach should yield similar results if repeated by another group.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Replicating a study on mangrove growth to confirm height data.
  - Repeating measurements of water temperature in a Florida bay.

## Part 2: Comparing Observations Across Groups (SC.3.N.1.2, SC.4.N.1.2)
- **Same Tools**:
  - Different groups using identical tools (e.g., thermometers) may get slightly different results due to human error, timing, or conditions.
  - Example: Two groups measuring sand temperature on a Florida beach with thermometers may differ due to slight variations in placement.
- **Multiple Tools**:
  - Different tools (e.g., digital vs. analog thermometers) may cause variations in data due to precision or calibration.
  - Example: Measuring wind speed with an anemometer vs. a wind sock in a Florida storm may yield different results.
- **Reasons for Differences**:
  - Tool precision, user technique, environmental conditions, or timing.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Comparing tide gauge vs. ruler measurements of water levels.
  - Groups observing dolphin jumps with different stopwatches.

## Part 3: Differences Due to Tools or Procedures (SC.4.N.1.2, SC.4.N.1.5)
- **Tools**:
  - Variations in tool accuracy or type affect results (e.g., a precise digital scale vs. a spring scale for weighing shells).
  - Example: Measuring plant growth with a ruler vs. a measuring tape in a Florida garden may differ slightly.
- **Procedures**:
  - Differences in methods (e.g., timing, steps, or conditions) cause data variations.
  - Example: One group waters plants daily, another weekly, affecting growth data in a Florida experiment.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Different procedures for counting fish in a reef (e.g., morning vs. evening counts).
  - Using different thermometers for ocean water temperature.

## Part 4: Repeated Trials (SC.5.N.1.3)
- **Need for Repeated Trials**:
  - Conducting an experiment multiple times ensures results are consistent and not due to chance.
  - Reduces errors and increases confidence in conclusions.
  - Example: Testing fertilizer on seagrass multiple times in a Florida lab to confirm growth patterns.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Repeating measurements of wave heights to ensure consistent data.
  - Conducting multiple trials of a plant watering experiment in a classroom.

## Part 5: Scientists’ Practices (SC.3.N.1.5)
- **Questioning and Checking**:
  - Scientists discuss, question, and verify each other’s evidence and explanations to ensure reliability.
  - Example: A scientist reviews another’s data on coral bleaching in Florida to confirm findings.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Sharing results and methods allows others to replicate and validate investigations.
- **Florida Context**:
  - Scientists discussing manatee migration data to agree on patterns.
  - Checking weather data from multiple Florida stations.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Replicability**: Evidence (data, observations, results, conclusions) must be repeatable by others.
- **Comparing Observations**: Differences arise from tools (precision, type) or procedures (methods, timing).
- **Repeated Trials**: Ensure consistent, reliable results.
- **Scientists’ Practices**: Question, discuss, and check evidence/explanations.
- **Limits**: Avoid “accurate”/“valid” terms; focus on conceptual understanding.
- **Florida Focus**: Use beaches, reefs, mangroves, weather for context.
