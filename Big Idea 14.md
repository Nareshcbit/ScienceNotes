## Notes

### Standard 1: SC.5.L.14.1 - Human Organs and Their Functions
**Overview**: The human body has organs that perform specific jobs to keep us alive and healthy. This standard focuses on identifying key organs and describing their general functions.

#### Key Organs and Functions
- **Skin**: Largest organ; protects against germs, regulates temperature, senses touch.
- **Brain**: Control center; manages thoughts, movements, senses.
- **Heart**: Pumps blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients.
- **Lungs**: Take in oxygen, release carbon dioxide.
- **Stomach**: Breaks down food with acids and enzymes.
- **Liver**: Cleans blood, processes nutrients, produces bile.
- **Intestines**:
  - **Small Intestine**: Absorbs nutrients into blood.
  - **Large Intestine**: Absorbs water, forms waste.
- **Pancreas**: Aids digestion, controls blood sugar with insulin.
- **Muscles**: Enable movement, work with skeleton.
- **Skeleton**: Supports body, protects organs, allows movement.
- **Reproductive Organs**: Produce sperm (testes) or eggs (ovaries) for reproduction.
- **Kidneys**: Filter blood, make urine.
- **Bladder**: Stores urine.
- **Sensory Organs**:
  - **Eyes**: See by detecting light.
  - **Ears**: Hear sounds, help with balance.
  - **Nose**: Smell, aid breathing.
  - **Tongue**: Taste, help speak/swallow.
  - **Skin**: Sense touch, pressure, pain.

**Key Points**:
- Each organ has a unique role but works with others.
- Focus on general functions, not specific parts or names of bones/muscles.
- Skin is both protective and sensory.

### Standard 2: SC.5.L.14.2 - Comparing Plant and Animal Structures, Classifying Organisms
**Overview**: Plants and animals have organs/structures with similar jobs (e.g., support, protection), but they differ in form and function. This standard also involves classifying animals and plants based on characteristics.

#### Part 1: Comparing Structures
- **Animal Structures**:
  - **Skeleton (Internal)**: Bones (e.g., humans, birds) support, protect, enable movement.
  - **Exoskeleton**: Hard outer covering (e.g., insects, crabs) supports, protects.
  - **Skin/Body Covering**: Protects, regulates temperature (e.g., fur, feathers, scales).
  - **Reproductive Organs**: Testes/ovaries produce sperm/eggs.
  - **Other Organs**: Brain, heart, lungs, gills, stomach, liver, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, sensory organs (as in SC.5.L.14.1).
- **Plant Structures**:
  - **Stem**: Supports, transports water/nutrients (like skeleton).
  - **Plant Covering**: Bark/waxy coating protects (like skin).
  - **Flower/Cone**: Produce seeds for reproduction (like testes/ovaries).
  - **Leaf**: Makes food via photosynthesis.
  - **Root**: Anchors, absorbs water/nutrients.
  - **Seed/Spore**: Reproductive units for new plants.
- **Key Comparisons**:
  - **Support**: Skeleton (animals) vs. stem (plants); both support, but skeletons move, stems are rigid.
  - **Protection**: Skin (animals) vs. plant covering; both protect, but skin senses touch, plant covering prevents water loss.
  - **Reproduction**: Testes/ovaries (animals) vs. flower/cone (plants); both produce offspring, but animals use sperm/eggs, plants use seeds/spores.

#### Part 2: Classifying Animals
- **Vertebrates** (backbone):
  - **Mammals**: Fur/hair, live birth, milk (e.g., dolphins, humans).
  - **Birds**: Feathers, hard-shelled eggs, most fly (e.g., ospreys).
  - **Reptiles**: Scales, leathery eggs (e.g., alligators).
  - **Amphibians**: Moist skin, water-based eggs (e.g., frogs).
  - **Fish**: Scales, gills, eggs (e.g., snook).
- **Invertebrates** (no backbone):
  - **Arthropods**: Exoskeleton, jointed legs (e.g., butterflies, crabs).
- **Reproduction**: Live birth (mammals, some reptiles) vs. egg-laying (birds, most reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods).

#### Part 3: Classifying Plants
- **Flowering Plants**: Produce seeds in flowers, often with fruits (e.g., mangroves).
- **Nonflowering Plants**:
  - **Seed-Producing**: Seeds in cones (e.g., pines).
  - **Spore-Producing**: Spores, no seeds (e.g., ferns).

**Key Points**:
- Compare functions, not specific parts.
- Focus on Florida-relevant organisms.
- Classification based on physical traits (e.g., feathers for birds) and behaviors (e.g., amphibians need water).

### Standard 3: SC.4.L.16.4 - Life Cycles of Florida Plants and Animals
**Overview**: Life cycles are the stages organisms go through from birth to reproduction. This standard compares life cycles of Florida plants (flowering/nonflowering seed-bearing) and animals (insects with metamorphosis, other animals).

#### Part 1: Insect Life Cycles
- **Complete Metamorphosis** (e.g., monarch butterfly, mosquito):
  - **Egg**: Laid on plants/water.
  - **Larva**: Feeding stage (e.g., caterpillar).
  - **Pupa**: Resting, transformation stage (e.g., chrysalis).
  - **Adult**: Reproduces, lays eggs.
- **Incomplete Metamorphosis** (e.g., lubber grasshopper, dragonfly):
  - **Egg**: Laid in soil/plants.
  - **Nymph**: Small, wingless adult-like stage; molts to grow.
  - **Adult**: Has wings, reproduces.

#### Part 2: Plant Life Cycles
- **Flowering Plants** (e.g., sea grapes, wildflowers):
  - **Seed**: Dormant, contains baby plant.
  - **Seedling**: Germinates, develops roots/leaves.
  - **Young Plant**: Grows stronger.
  - **Adult Plant**: Produces flowers, seeds.
- **Nonflowering Seed-Bearing Plants** (e.g., slash pines):
  - **Seed**: In cones.
  - **Seedling**: Small tree/shrub.
  - **Young Plant**: Grows taller.
  - **Adult Plant**: Produces cones, seeds.

#### Part 3: Other Animal Life Cycles
- **Stages** (e.g., sea turtles, ospreys, alligators):
  - **Egg**: Contains embryo.
  - **Embryo**: Develops in egg.
  - **Juvenile**: Resembles adult, grows/learns.
  - **Adult**: Reproduces, lays eggs.
- **Key Features**: No metamorphosis; juveniles look like adults.

**Key Points**:
- Focus on Florida organisms (e.g., mangroves, monarchs, alligators).
- Compare stages by purpose (e.g., larva vs. tadpole for growth).
- Plants use seeds, insects use metamorphosis, other animals have juvenile stages.
