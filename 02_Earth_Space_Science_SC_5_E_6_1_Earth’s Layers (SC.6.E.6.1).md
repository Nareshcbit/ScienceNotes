# Notes: Earth’s Layers (SC.6.E.6.1)

## Overview
This standard helps you understand that Earth is like a big ball with four layers: the **crust**, **mantle**, **outer core**, and **inner core**. Each layer has different materials (like rocks or metal) and is either solid or liquid. Think of Earth as a layered fruit, with a thin skin (crust) and deeper parts inside. These notes are written for 5th graders to make 6th-grade ideas easy to understand.

## Part 1: Earth’s Layered Structure
- **Earth’s Layers**: Earth has four main layers, each doing something special, like giving us land to walk on (crust) or making compasses work (outer core).
- **Why Layers Matter**: The crust is where we live, and the core helps create a magnetic field, like a big magnet for compasses.

## Part 2: The Four Layers

1. **Crust**:
   - **Description**: The thin, solid outer layer we live on, made of rocks like granite or basalt.
   - **Characteristics**: Solid, includes land (continents) and ocean floors. It’s super thin, like the skin of an apple.
   - **Example**: The ground you walk on, like mountains or plains, is part of the crust.

2. **Mantle**:
   - **Description**: A thick layer under the crust, made of hot, semi-solid rock that flows slowly, like thick syrup or gooey candy.
   - **Characteristics**: Mostly solid but moves a little because it’s so hot, like a slow-moving river of rock.
   - **Example**: Imagine the mantle as a hot, gooey layer deep underground, too far to see.

3. **Outer Core**:
   - **Description**: A liquid layer of melted iron and nickel, deep inside Earth, surrounding the inner core.
   - **Characteristics**: Very hot, liquid, and moves to create Earth’s magnetic field (think of it as a big magnet that helps compasses point north).
   - **Example**: Picture the outer core as a hot, liquid metal soup spinning inside Earth.

4. **Inner Core**:
   - **Description**: The deepest, solid ball of iron and nickel, super hot but solid because of huge pressure squishing it.
   - **Characteristics**: Solid, dense, and keeps Earth stable, like the hard center of a jawbreaker candy.
   - **Example**: Think of the inner core as a super-hot, solid metal ball at Earth’s center.

## Part 3: How Layers Are Studied
- **Indirect Evidence**: Scientists can’t dig to the core because it’s too deep and hot, so they use **earthquake waves** to learn about layers (like shaking a box to guess what’s inside).
- **Example**: It’s like tapping a watermelon to hear if it’s ripe—scientists “tap” Earth with waves to find out what’s inside.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Layers**: **Crust** (solid rock, thin), **mantle** (semi-solid rock, thick), **outer core** (liquid metal), **inner core** (solid metal).
- **Characteristics**: Each layer has different materials (rock vs. metal) and states (solid vs. liquid).
- **Simplified for 5th Grade**: Earth is like a layered ball, with a rocky skin (crust), gooey middle (mantle), and metal center (cores).
- **Limits**: Focus on what layers are and what they’re made of, not numbers (e.g., thickness) or complex processes (e.g., plate tectonics).
