# Notes: Earth’s Layers (SC.6.E.6.1)

## Overview
This standard helps you understand that Earth is made of layers, like a big ball with different parts: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. Each layer has special materials (like rocks or metal) and is either solid or liquid. For 5th graders, think of Earth as a layered fruit, with a thin skin (crust) and deeper parts inside. We’ll use pictures to make it clear and connect to Florida, like the sandy beaches or limestone rocks you see around you!

*Description*: This picture shows Earth cut in half, like slicing an apple. You see four layers: the thin crust (brown), thick mantle (red/orange), liquid outer core (yellow), and solid inner core (white). Labels point to each layer, making it easy to see how they fit together.

*Why It Helps*: Shows all layers at once, so you can picture Earth’s structure.

## Part 1: Earth’s Layered Structure
- **Earth’s Layers**: Earth has four main layers, each doing something special, like holding us up (crust) or making a magnetic field (core).
- **Why Layers Matter**: The crust gives us land to live on, and the core helps compasses work, like for sailors in Florida’s oceans.
- **Florida Context**: The ground you walk on in Florida is the crust, often made of limestone rocks or sand seen on beaches.

## Part 2: The Four Layers

1. **Crust**:
   - **Description**: The thin, solid outer layer we live on, made of rocks like granite or limestone.
   - **Characteristics**: Solid, includes land (like continents) and ocean floors.
   - **Florida Context**: Florida’s crust is mostly limestone, which you can see in sinkholes or coral reefs.
   - **Example**: The sandy beaches or rocky cliffs in Florida are part of the crust.

   **Image 2: Florida Limestone Crust**

   *Description*: This picture shows a rocky, white limestone formation on a Florida beach, with waves nearby. It looks rough and solid, showing the crust we walk on.  
   *Source*: Wikimedia Commons (Creative Commons, CC BY-SA).  
   *Why It Helps*: Connects the crust to something familiar in Florida, making it real.

2. **Mantle**:
   - **Description**: A thick layer under the crust, made of hot, semi-solid rock that flows slowly, like thick syrup.
   - **Characteristics**: Mostly solid but moves a bit because it’s so hot, like gooey candy.
   - **Florida Context**: The mantle’s heat helps create hot springs in Florida, where warm water comes up from deep underground.
   - **Example**: Imagine the mantle as a hot, gooey layer under Florida’s beaches, too deep to see.

   **Image 3: Mantle Representation (Magma)**  
   ![Mantle Magma](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Magma_chamber.svg)  
   *Description*: This picture shows red, flowing magma under the crust, like the mantle’s semi-solid rock. It looks like hot, glowing syrup, with the crust above it.  
   *Source*: Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain, USGS).  
   *Why It Helps*: Shows the mantle’s gooey nature, making it easier to understand.

3. **Outer Core**:
   - **Description**: A liquid layer of melted iron and nickel, deep inside Earth.
   - **Characteristics**: Very hot, liquid, and moves to create Earth’s magnetic field (like a big magnet for compasses).
   - **Florida Context**: The magnetic field helps Florida sailors use compasses to navigate the ocean.
   - **Example**: Think of the outer core as a hot, liquid metal soup spinning inside Earth.

   **Image 4: Earth’s Magnetic Field**  
   ![Earth’s Magnetic Field](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Earth%27s_Magnetic_Field_Confusion.svg)  
   *Description*: This picture shows Earth with glowing lines curving around it, representing the magnetic field made by the liquid outer core. A compass in the corner points north.  
   *Source*: Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain, NASA).  
   *Why It Helps*: Shows what the outer core does, connecting to compasses kids might see.

4. **Inner Core**:
   - **Description**: The deepest, solid ball of iron and nickel, super hot but solid because of huge pressure.
   - **Characteristics**: Solid, dense, and keeps Earth stable.
   - **Florida Context**: The inner core is far below Florida, helping hold Earth together.
   - **Example**: Picture the inner core as a super-hot, solid metal ball at Earth’s center.

   **Image 5: Inner Core Diagram**  
   ![Inner Core Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Earth%27s_inner_core_diagram.png)  
   *Description*: This picture zooms in on Earth’s center, showing a shiny, white ball (inner core) inside a yellow liquid (outer core). It looks like a solid metal marble.  
   *Source*: Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain, USGS).  
   *Why It Helps*: Makes the inner core clear as a solid, deep part, distinct from the liquid outer core.

## Part 3: How Layers Are Studied
- **Indirect Evidence**: Scientists can’t dig to the core, so they use earthquake waves to learn about layers (like shaking a box to guess what’s inside).
- **Florida Context**: Even though Florida doesn’t have many earthquakes, scientists study waves from faraway quakes to understand layers under our state.
- **Example**: It’s like tapping a melon to hear if it’s ripe—scientists “tap” Earth to find out what’s inside.

**Image 6: Earthquake Waves**  
![Earthquake Waves](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Seismic_waves.svg)  
*Description*: This picture shows wavy lines moving through Earth’s layers, labeled as earthquake waves. The lines bend or stop at layers like the mantle and core, showing how scientists study them.  
*Source*: Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain, USGS).  
*Why It Helps*: Explains how we learn about deep layers without digging, in a simple way.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Layers**: Crust (solid rock, thin), mantle (semi-solid rock, thick), outer core (liquid metal), inner core (solid metal).
- **Characteristics**: Each layer has different materials (rock vs. metal) and states (solid vs. liquid).
- **Florida Focus**: Limestone crust in beaches, mantle heat in springs, outer core for compasses.
- **Simplified for 5th Grade**: Earth is like a layered ball, with a rocky skin (crust), gooey middle (mantle), and metal center (cores).
- **Limits**: Focus on what layers are, not numbers (e.g., thickness) or complex processes (e.g., plate tectonics).
