# Data and Statistics: Notes and Multiple-Choice Questions

## Notes on Data and Statistics (Aligned with Florida Math Standards, Grades 5–8)

### 5th Grade (MAFS.5.MD.2)
1. **Line Plots**:
   - A line plot displays data using marks (e.g., X’s) above a number line to show frequency.
   - Used for small data sets, often involving fractions or measurements.
   - Example: A line plot of test scores shows how many students scored each value.
   - Interpret line plots to find totals, differences, or redistributions (e.g., dividing data equally).

### 6th Grade (MAFS.6.SP.1, MAFS.6.SP.2)
2. **Statistical Questions**:
   - A statistical question anticipates variability in answers.
   - Example: “What are the heights of students?” (varies) vs. “What is my height?” (single answer).

3. **Measures of Center and Variability**:
   - **Mean**: Average; sum of data divided by the number of values. Example: For 2, 4, 6, mean = $\frac{2 + 4 + 6}{3} = 4$.
   - **Median**: Middle value when data is ordered. Example: For 3, 5, 7, median = 5.
   - **Mode**: Most frequent value. Example: For 1, 2, 2, 3, mode = 2.
   - **Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum values. Example: For 1, 5, 9, range = $9 - 1 = 8$.

4. **Data Displays**:
   - Dot plots, histograms, and box plots summarize data distributions.
   - **Box Plot**: Shows minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum.

### 7th Grade (MAFS.7.SP.1, MAFS.7.SP.2, MAFS.7.SP.3, MAFS.7.SP.4)
5. **Random Sampling**:
   - A random sample represents a population without bias.
   - Example: Surveying 50 randomly selected students to estimate school preferences.

6. **Comparing Populations**:
   - Use measures of center (mean, median) and variability (range, interquartile range) to compare two data sets.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: $Q3 - Q1$, measures spread of middle 50% of data.

7. **Probability**:
   - Probability measures likelihood, from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
   - Simple probability: $P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$.
   - Example: Probability of rolling a 3 on a die: $\frac{1}{6}$.

### 8th Grade (MAFS.8.SP.1, MAFS.8.SP.2)
8. **Bivariate Data**:
   - Involves two variables, often displayed in scatter plots.
   - Identify patterns: positive correlation (both increase), negative correlation (one increases, other decreases), or no correlation.

9. **Line of Best Fit**:
   - A straight line that models the trend in a scatter plot.
   - Used to predict values and analyze relationships between variables.
   - Example: Height vs. shoe size may show a positive trend.

## Answers and Explanations

1. **Answer**: C) $2 \frac{1}{4}$ hours
   - **Explanation**: Calculate total time: 5 students at $\frac{1}{4}$ hour = $5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$; 3 at $\frac{1}{2}$ hour = $3 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$; 2 at $\frac{3}{4}$ hour = $2 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{4}$. Sum: $\frac{5}{4} + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{6}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{17}{4} = 4 \frac{1}{4}$. Convert: $4 \frac{1}{4} = 2 \frac{1}{4}$ hours (since $4 \div 2 = 2$).

2. **Answer**: B) What are the temperatures this week?
   - **Explanation**: A statistical question expects varied answers. “What are the temperatures this week?” yields multiple values, unlike the others, which have single answers.

3. **Answer**: A) 5
